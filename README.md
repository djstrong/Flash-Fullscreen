Flash Fullscreen
===========================

Allows to make any flash object (e.g. game) fullscreen.

Show button with name "Fullscreen" after each flash animation. Clicking on it go to fullscreen mode showing only flash object. After quiting from this mode everything back to the same state.

Works also with iframes. Some flash objects are not scaling by design.

On request I can create options with white and black list of domains or setting minimal dimensions of flash object after which button is shown.
